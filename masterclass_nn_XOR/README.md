# Masterclass Neural Network - XOR 
In this repo the code and presentation can be found for the Masterclass for starting with Neural Networks.

## Goal
1. Provide general insight into how a neural network functions.
2. Enable to write a very primitive neural network, based on XOR categorization (without ML libraries)

## Outline
1. Show use cases for Neural Networks
2. Explain structure: 
    * Why is it called a Neural Network?
    * Show how it's heavily based on mathmatics
    * How does a network learn?
3. Explain the simple XOR example
4. Open up python file and explain what is needed:
    * Input data
    * Activation function and its derivative
    * Training: feedforward and backpropagation
    * Prediction
5. Walkthrough all the needed pieces of the python file, and type them out (live)
6. Execute the script, and 
7. Recap: 
    * Where to go from now if you are interested?
    * Other use cases
