# Masterclass Neural Network - XOR 
This repo is for the masterclass I give at April 23 in Mexico city.

## Goal
1. Provide general insight into how a neural network functions.
2. Enable students to write a very primitive neural network, based on XOR categorization

## Outline
1. Show use cases for Neural Networks
2. Explain structure: 
..* Why is it called a Neural Network?

  Show how it's heavily based on mathmatics
  * How does a network learn?
3. Explain the simple XOR example
4. Open up python file and explain what is needed:
  * Input data
  * Activation function and its derivative
  * Training: feedforward and backpropagation
  * Prediction
5. Walkthrough all the needed pieces of the python file, and type them out (live)
6. Execute the script, and 
7. Recap: 
  * Where to go from now if you are interested?
  * Other use cases
